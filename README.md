# Codsoft_task1

As a budding Data Science Intern at CodSoft, I tackled the challenge of predicting Titanic survival on GitHub. Armed with Python skills, I navigated data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model selection like Logistic Regression. Collaborating with experienced peers taught me version control and code enhancement. Despite challenges, I emerged with a refined model and a valuable lesson in resilience, coding, and real-world data complexities. This GitHub project is my proof of dedication and growth as a data enthusiast.
